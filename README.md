# depreciation_problems

This is the beginning of a problem generator for accounting students. 

I want to format it better and to put in another button that solves the problem and shows the student the answer and maybe also how the answer was reached.

I'd also like to extend this one by including double-declining balance and units-of-production problems as well. In addition, I can also see providing problems where data for multiple kinds of depreciation is provided and a specific kind of depreciation is requested. We'll see if I'm still into it by the time I get there.
